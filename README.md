# Dataset:
The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms. The archive was created as an FTP archive in 1987 by David Aha and fellow graduate students at UC Irvine. Since that time, it has been widely used by students, educators, and researchers all over the world as a primary source of machine learning data sets.

One of the regression datasets of the UCI repository, the real estate dataset, is chosen and split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% test data.
